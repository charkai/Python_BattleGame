# Python_BattleGame
My first project: a text-based battle game in python. 

This semester was my first introduction to coding, in semester 1 of 2021. I had no prior coding experience before taking INFO1110, Introduction to Programming. 

This game, constructed for the unit of study, demonstrates my first interactions with coding fundamentals such as control flow, functions and classes. 

I simply used an IDE to code this assignment and did not use any version control at the time of writing it.

To play the game, use the command 'python3 little_battle.py config.txt'. You can edit the configuration file (or make a new one and simply load that filepath) to create different games. This is a two-player battle game. 
To quit at any time, enter QUIT. Otherwise, follow the instructions created in the terminal!
